The design goal was to have each section separated by color and to have the page have a clean and modern look to it. The site uses bootstrap for a responsive layout system and a simple working navigation bar. There is minimal javascript to animate the navigation scrolling and to add the span circles after the fact to keep my main html file clean.

The font chosen was Google's "Open Sans", with most of the body text using it's regular variation and the headers using a light variation. This font is pretty to look at and as a san-serif fine for reading small blocks of text.

The site navigation will always stay on the top and the sections can be scrolled to quickly by clicking on the links (the current section is always highlighted).

All elements on the page will properly re-size themselves for different screen sizes, with slightly altered layouts. On a phone, the navbar will change completely to be more mobile friendly.

I choose the style of a one page resume with the future plan being to add a second page for my design and photography portfolio (not on the main page as it is of less importance to my career goals). So with additional time that is the main thing I would like to add. Another thing I would like to do is make my work experience section in to more of a timeline layout, but this would take more experimentation and time to make it look clean.

I do have two version of the site:
One with the skill circles (http://jake-freeman.github.io)
and another without them (http://mypages.iit.edu/~jfreeman)

Since you don't like the skill circle or the empty spans the mypages one is the version to be graded.
